# Fuzzy Matcher

This repo is created for the development of an easy-to-use, GUI-based fuzzy matcher. Initially designed for use with Food Composition Tables, it has been adapted to be used with any two datasets, each comprising of a two-column data.frame; the first column being an ID column and the second being an item name column.

The first data.frame inputted is the primary dataset, and potential matches are found from the secondary dataset and presented as potential options to be confirmed in the GUI interface.
